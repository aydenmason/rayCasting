golang raylib [bindings](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go/raylib)

dead project at this point. started a new game engine project thats in C++ as using bindings just seemed like a waste of time. new repo is private for now. But this book taught me the fundamentals. Highly reccomend.
